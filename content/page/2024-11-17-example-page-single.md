In the graphic design and illustration program at the part time art school of the academy of royal arts, Antwerp, I received the assignment to design a cover for a single vinyl record. 

I chose the track “Today”, by Tirzah and Mura Masa, as I was intrigued by how multi-faceted it is. Overall, the music is quite dreamy, with the narrator thinking about experiences in the past and jumping back and forth between the perspective of self from the past and the current perspective of self looking back at their past. There is also an ambiguity in the tone of the song, ranging from happy and hopeful to sad and disappointed. 

I decided to translate these multiple aspects by using the vinyl record as a sort of turntable that would change the look of the cover, depending on how it is positioned inside of it and to be altered by turning the vinyl around inside of the cover. The cover, with openings in the form of a face, represents the ambiguity of the narrator / the self. On top of the regular cover, there is another sleeve which is made out of mirroring paper, inviting the user of the record to look at the current self.
