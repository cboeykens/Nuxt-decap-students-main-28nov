The data visualization above is an extract from a study in my PhD. For this study, observers were repeatedly shown an ambiguous stimulus (a single image that can be perceived in multiple ways), called the ‘motion quartet’, which may be perceived as clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation, depending on the observer and the moment. For each stimulus presentation, they were instructed to indicate which of the two possible percepts they perceived. 

Each of the plots in the data visualization below represents comparisons of the percepts of one observer over time. On the x- and y-axis, you can see numbers representing the different stimulus presentations over time. If the observer had the same percept on two certain stimulus presentations (e.g., the 3rd and 5th stimulus presentation), the dot in the plot corresponding to the two stimulus presentations in question (e.g., the dot on the intersection of 3 on the x-axis and 5 on the y-axis) will be colored grey, indicating a recurrence. If the percepts were different, this dot will be colored yellow. 

The plots in this visualization can give us an indication of how stable vs. variable different observers are in their perception over time. The observers in the top plot have very little variability in their percepts over time, as almost all dots in the plot are repetitions (recurrence) of the previous percepts. The observers in the middle have medium variability, and the observers on the bottom have a high variability in their percepts over time, as can be seen in the amount of alternations between grey and yellow dots in the plots.
