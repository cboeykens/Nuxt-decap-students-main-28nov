description: Haddok is a lunch bar in Ghent for which I designed the logo. Haddok serves a delicious lunch and has a terrace facing a beautiful sunset within the scenery of the old docks. I based the design of the letters on the shape of the windows of the buildings of the old docks and the accompanying illustration on the huge blue harbour crane standing right next to their building.
