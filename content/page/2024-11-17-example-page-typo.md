In the graphic design and illustration program at the part time art school of the academy of royal arts, Antwerp, I received the assignment to design an experimental captial font, starting from a given basic alphabet in capital letters on paper. 

I wanted to create the illusion of movement and for the end result I used the full cut-out letters, physically bent in waves. I tried to illustrate the effect of water on the appearance of the blocked letters and made two different posters to experiment with this. The first poster hints at the appearance of objects under water, such as the distortion of straight lines in tiles on the bottom of a pool. With the second poster I tried to create the visual distortion caused by water drops.

Out of these experiments we created a very basic useable typeface, but the appearance of the letters without variations in brightness was very different from my intention.
