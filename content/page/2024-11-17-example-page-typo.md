In the graphic design and illustration program at the part time art school of the academy of royal arts, Antwerp, I received the assignment to design a captial font, starting from a given basic alphabet on paper. I wanted to create movement in the typeface and tried to achieve this by cutting out the letters and playing around with them in multiple ways. 
The end result was based on the full cut-out letters, physically bent in waves.
